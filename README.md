Title: Spill The Deej

Description:
A website with a stream of messages from a bot.
This bot can also take in messages and display them on screen.
Certain messages given to the bot can trigger changes in the website revealing new information
about the bot and where the messages are from.
There are also two archive webpages. One for everyone and one for those with a password.
These webpages will show the previous messages that have been put in the system.

Outline:

- Homepage: On the left side of the screen, there will be an image of the confession bot.
  Next to it will be the send messages button. On the right side will be the stream of messages.
- Archives: This webpage will contain a lot of messages which have been the past messages in the system.
  It will have a pagination section in the bottom to select which confessions you will see in the middle.
- Admin Archives: This webpage will require a password to enter. When this password is entered, the user will be directed to a webpage very similar to the archives.

JS Description:
